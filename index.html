            <h2>FOLLOWING IS A DESCRIPTION OF MY FIRST FLIGHT CANCELLATION</h2>
            <p>Today me and my family experienced our first ever flight cancellation. Funnily enough, this folder was first created on the airplane we were meant to fly on as a demonstration to my brother. After an hour of demonstration: myself teaching HTML to my brother and my brother teaching me LUAU, we learned that the flight was cancelled. At first, we were supposed to <strong>depart</strong> at about 9:30, but eventually we <strong>boarded</strong> the Airbus A321 at about 10:30. Apparently, one component of the plane was too hot to service. Really it was probably an IT issue from the crowdstrike outage. OOPS! We were told at about 11:30. I am writing this message from the baggage terminal after we deplaned, which took forever. So far we have no bags (claim is off) and no accomadations. <strong>12:19 AM</strong></p>
